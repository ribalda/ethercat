This is a minimal example module for the use of the EtherCAT master realtime
interface. It uses a kernel timer to generate a cyclic task.

Most probably you'll have different EtherCAT slaves present. Try adjusting the
section "process data" in mini.c to your bus configuration.

There are some features that can be disabled by commenting out the respective
defines at the head of mini.c.

---

To build the example module, call:

make modules

To run it, call:

insmod ec_mini.ko

...and watch the system logs for the outputs.
