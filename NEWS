Changes in version 1.2.0:

* Re-introduced ecrt_domain_queue() to allow datagram queuing apart
  from datagram processing. The queuing of a domain's datagrams is not
  done in ecrt_domain_process() any more!
* Removed ecrt_master_deactivate(). Its functionality was moved into
  ecrt_master_release().
* Removed ecrt_master_prepare(). Its functionality was moved into
  ecrt_master_activate().
* Renamed ecdev_start() and ecdev_stop() to ecdev_open() and ecdev_close().
  These two functions now take a pointer to ec_device_t as their arguments.
* The data_ptr parameter of ecrt_domain_register_pdo(),
  ecrt_domain_register_pdo_list() and ecrt_domain_register_pdo_range() may
  not be NULL any more.
* Removed ecrt_slave_pdo_size(). This function was deprecated long before.
* Added frame counter to master info file.
