#
# Main Ethernet devices.
#
# The MASTER<X>_DEVICE variable specifies the Ethernet device for a master
# with index 'X'.
#
# Specify the MAC address (hexadecimal with colons) of the Ethernet device to
# use. Example: "00:00:08:44:ab:66"
#
# The broadcast address "ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff" has a special meaning: It tells
# the master to accept the first device offered by any Ethernet driver.
#
# The MASTER<X>_DEVICE variables also determine, how many masters will be
# created: A non-empty variable MASTER0_DEVICE will create one master, adding a
# non-empty variable MASTER1_DEVICE will create a second master, and so on.
#
MASTER0_DEVICE=""
#MASTER1_DEVICE=""

#
# Backup Ethernet devices
#
# The MASTER<X>_BACKUP variables specify the devices used for redundancy. They
# behaves nearly the same as the MASTER<X>_DEVICE variable, except that it
# does not interpret the ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff address.
#
#MASTER0_BACKUP=""

#
# Initial EOE interfaces
#
# Specify EOE interface names that need to be configured on initialization and
# be available regardless of whether the related module is installed.
#
# EOE interface names can be specified with either of the following formats:
#   eoe<MASTER>a<SLAVE_ALIAS>
#   eoe<MASTER>s<SLAVE_RING_POSITION>
#
# Note: it is preferable to use the alias version to ensure the slave is matched
#   regarless of its ring position.  If multiple slaves share the same alias
#   the first matching EOE slave will claim it.
#
# Separate multiple interfaces with commas
# e.g.: eoe0s20,eoe0a100
#
#EOE_INTERFACES=""

#
# EOE auto create mode
#
# If EOE auto create is true (default) then EOE interfaces will be automatically
# created as required if a new EOE module is connected.  If it is false
# then you will need to create EOE interfaces by specifying them under the
# EOE_INTERFACES key above, or by using the "ethercat eoe_addif" tool.
#
#EOE_AUTOCREATE="1"

#
# PCAP logging size
#
# Sets how much memory (in mebibytes) to reserve for PCAP logging (default 0).
# This is a non-overwriting log of raw packets which can be downloaded (and
# cleared, to receive additional packets) using the "ethercat pcap" command,
# and then can be transferred to another host running Wireshark or another
# libpcap-compatible tool.
#
#PCAP_SIZE_MB="30"

#
# Ethernet driver modules to use for EtherCAT operation.
#
# Specify a non-empty list of Ethernet drivers, that shall be used for
# EtherCAT operation.
#
# Except for the generic Ethernet driver module, the init script will try to
# unload the usual Ethernet driver modules in the list and replace them with
# the EtherCAT-capable ones. If a certain (EtherCAT-capable) driver is not
# found, a warning will appear.
#
# Possible values: 8139too, e100, e1000, e1000e, r8169, generic, ccat, igb.
# Separate multiple drivers with spaces.
#
# Note: The e100, e1000, e1000e, r8169, ccat and igb drivers are not built by
# default. Enable them with the --enable-<driver> configure switches.
#
# Attention: When using the generic driver, the corresponding Ethernet device
# has to be activated (with OS methods, for example 'ip link set ethX up'),
# before the master is started, otherwise all frames will time out.
#
DEVICE_MODULES=""

#
# Flags for loading kernel modules.
#
# This can usually be left empty. Adjust this variable, if you have problems
# with module loading.
#
#MODPROBE_FLAGS="-b"

#
# Ethernet devices to bring up when starting EtherCAT.
#
# Specify one or more network devices that you want to control link state of.
# Listed devices will have set link state to "up" when starting EtherCAT.
#
#LINK_DEVICES="eth0"
